- v. 1.1.4

  - Version 1 release. Support for objects and arrays being passed in. Under the hood, objects were still being used to manage the state value and the value setter. No abstract key support.

- v. 2.0.0
  - Version 2 release. Support for abstract values now in place. To accomplish this we no longer depend on objects at all and now use a map inside a map. This version also introduces the `complexKeysEnabled` config property which returns only getters and setters and allows a user to use an object as a key for state management
